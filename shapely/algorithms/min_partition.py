    The main algorithm.
    Performs minimum edge length partitioning of a rectilinear polygon into rectangles.

    Args:
        polygon_points (list of tuple): List of tuples representing the vertices of the rectilinear polygon.
                                        Each adjacent pair of points has an edge, including between the first and the last point.

    Returns:
        list of list of tuple: A list where each element is a list of tuples representing the vertices of the rectangles
                               resulting from the partition. or None if not found (in case the polygon isn't rectilinear).
