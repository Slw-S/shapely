class STRtree:
    """
    A query-only R-tree spatial index created using the
    Sort-Tile-Recursive (STR) [1]_ algorithm.

    For two-dimensional spatial data. The tree is constructed directly
    at initialization. The tree is immutable and query-only, meaning that
    once created nodes cannot be added or removed.

    An index is initialized from a sequence of geometry objects and
    optionally a sequence of items. If items are not provided, the
    indices of the geometry sequence will be used instead.

    Stored items and corresponding geometry objects can be spatially
    queried using another geometric object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    geoms : sequence
        A sequence of geometry objects.
    items : sequence, optional
        A sequence of objects which typically serve as identifiers in an
        application. This sequence must have the same length as geoms.
    node_capacity : int, default 10
        The maximum number of child nodes per parent node in the tree.

    Examples
    --------
    Creating an index of polygons:

    >>> from shapely.strtree import STRtree
    >>> from shapely.geometry import Polygon
    >>>
    >>> polys = [Polygon(((0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1))),

    >>> polys[0] in result

        """
        Return the index (or stored item) of all geometries in the tree
        with extents that intersect the envelope of the input geometry.

        The returned items may be identified by an integer index (default) or
        arbitrary item values (optional) if those are provided when
        constructing the tree.

        By default, the returned items correspond with those geometries from
        the tree for which the envelope intersects with the envelope of the
        input geometry. Optionally, results can be filtered by a spatial
        predicate involving the input geometry (this is done on the actual
        geometries, and not their envelopes).

        If a predicate is provided, a prepared version of the input geometry
        is tested using the predicate function against each item whose
        extent intersects the envelope of the input geometry:
        predicate(input_geometry, tree_geometry).

        The 'dwithin' predicate requires GEOS >= 3.10.

        If geometry is None or empty, an empty array is returned.

        Parameters
        ----------
        geom : Geometry
            The envelope of the geometry is taken automatically for
            querying the tree.
        predicate : {None, 'intersects', 'within', 'contains', 'overlaps', 'crosses',\
'touches', 'covers', 'covered_by', 'contains_properly', 'dwithin'}, optional
            The predicate to use for testing geometries from the tree
            that are within the input geometry's envelope.
        distance : number, optional
            Distance around the geometry within which to query the tree for the
            'dwithin' predicate.  Required if predicate='dwithin'.

        Returns
        -------
        ndarray
            An array of indexes (or stored items) of geometries in the tree
        Note
        ----
        A geometry object's "envelope" is its minimum xy bounding
        rectangle.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> import shapely
        >>> tree = shapely.STRtree(shapely.points(np.arange(10), np.arange(10)))
        >>> tree.query_items(shapely.box(1,1, 3,3)).tolist()
        [1, 2, 3]
        >>> # Query geometries that are contained by input geometry
        >>> tree.query_items(shapely.box(2, 2, 4, 4), predicate='contains').tolist()

        >>> tree.query_items(shapely.points(0.5, 0.5), predicate='dwithin', distance=1.0).tolist()  # doctest: +SKIP
        [0, 1]

        A buffer around a point can be used to control the extent
        of the query.

        >>> from shapely.strtree import STRtree
        >>> from shapely.geometry import Point
        >>> points = [Point(i, i) for i in range(10)]

        >>> [o.wkt for o in tree.query(query_geom)]
        ['POINT (1 1)', 'POINT (2 2)', 'POINT (3 3)']

        A subsequent search through the returned subset using the
        desired binary predicate (eg. intersects, crosses, contains,
        overlaps) may be necessary to further filter the results
        according to their specific spatial relationships.

        associated with each.  To generate an array of pairs of input geometry
        index and tree geometry index, simply transpose the results.

        In the context of a spatial join, input geometries are the "left" geometries

        for each input geometry and may not be in ascending index order; no meaningful
        order is implied.

        The max_distance used to search for nearest items in the tree may have a
        significant impact on performance by reducing the number of input geometries
        that are evaluated for nearest items in the tree.  Only those input geometries
        with at least one tree item within +/- max_distance beyond their envelope will
        be evaluated.

        The distance, if returned, will be 0 for any intersected geometries in the tree.

        Any geometry that is None or empty in the input geometries is omitted from
        the output.

        Parameters
        ----------
        geometry : Geometry or array_like
            Input geometries to query the tree.
        max_distance : float, optional
            Maximum distance within which to query for nearest items in tree.
            Must be greater than 0.
        return_distance : bool, default False
            If True, will return distances in addition to indexes.

        Returns
        -------
        indices or tuple of (indices, distances)
            indices is an ndarray of shape (2,n) and distances (if present) an
            ndarray of shape (n).
            The first subarray of indices contains input geometry indices.
            The second subarray of indices contains tree geometry indices.

        --------
        nearest: returns singular nearest geometry for each input
