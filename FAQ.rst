Frequently asked questions and answers
======================================

Are there references for the algorithms used by shapely?
------------------------------------------------------------

Generally speaking, shapely's predicates and operations are derived from
methods of the same name from the `JTS Topology Suite
<https://locationtech.github.io/jts/>`__.  See the JTS FAQ for `references
describing the JTS algorithms
<https://locationtech.github.io/jts/jts-faq.html#E1>`__.
